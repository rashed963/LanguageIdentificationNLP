        "\n",
        "This section is dedicated to handling the operations for the TF-IDF vectorized model. We follow a structured approach to train the model, evaluate its performance, and then save it for future use. This process ensures that we have a deployable model at hand without the need to retrain.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Training the Model\n",
        "We start by training our model using the `train_and_tune_model` function with the TF-IDF vectorization approach. This function not only trains the model but also tunes its hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to find the optimal model settings. This ensures that our model performs at its best.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Evaluating the Model\n",
        "Once the model is trained, we use the `predict_and_evaluate` function to test the model's performance on a separate test dataset. This function predicts the languages of the texts in the test dataset and calculates the accuracy, providing a quantitative measure of the model's effectiveness.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Saving the Model\n",
        "After confirming the model's performance, we save the trained model to disk using `joblib`. This step is crucial as it allows us to reuse the trained model without undergoing the training process again, saving both time and computational resources. The model is stored in the 'models' directory under the name `model_tfidf.joblib`.\n",
        "\n",
        "This end-to-end process from training to saving ensures that our model is not only accurate but also readily available for deployment or further experimentation.\n"

        "This section focuses on the procedures using the Word2Vec model. We demonstrate the comprehensive steps from training the model with Word2Vec embeddings, evaluating its performance on the test data, and finally saving the model for later use. These steps ensure our model is both effective and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Training the Word2Vec Model\n",
        "The `train_and_tune_model` function is utilized here with the `word2vec` vectorization type. Unlike traditional TF-IDF, Word2Vec provides a dense representation of words which captures semantic relationships. This function trains the model using these embeddings and integrates them into a logistic regression framework to predict the languages. It's designed to offer a deep understanding of context within the text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Evaluating the Model\n",
        "After training, the performance of the Word2Vec model is evaluated using the `predict_and_evaluate` function. This function applies the trained model to the test dataset to predict languages, and calculates the accuracy to quantify how well our model performs in real-world scenarios. This step is crucial for validating the effectiveness of the Word2Vec embeddings in the task of language identification.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Saving the Model\n",
        "Once we verify the model's performance and are satisfied with the results, the final step is to save this model using `joblib`. Saving the model to the 'models' directory as `model_word2vec.joblib` allows us to deploy or further experiment with the model without the need for retraining, ensuring efficiency and readiness for practical applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "By following these structured steps, we ensure that our Word2Vec model is not only trained to capture the nuances of different languages but also ready for immediate deployment or further development.\n"
